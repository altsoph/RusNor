1. Phonological Rules:
- Replace Russian х → k
- Replace Russian в → v
- Replace Russian ш, щ, ж → s
- Simplify consonant clusters by:
  * Adding vowels between consonants
  * Dropping one of the consonants
  * Converting complex sounds to simple ones

2. Vowel Rules:
- Convert Russian о → å in stressed positions
- Preserve Norwegian å
- Simplify Russian ё → e/jo
- Keep basic vowels a, e, i, o, u
- Drop complex Russian vowel patterns

3. Morphological Rules:
For Verbs:
- Add -om to verb stems (primary rule)
- Alternative: use simplified stem + -a

For Nouns:
- Add -a to basic stems
- Add -ka to some stems (especially for tools/items)
- For Russian nouns: drop complex endings, add -a/-ka

For Adjectives:
- Convert Russian -ый/-ий → -i
- Convert Norwegian -ig → -i
- Use -li ending for some qualitative adjectives

4. Word Structure Rules:
- Prefer bisyllabic structure
- Keep stress on first syllable where possible
- Allow compound words but simplify their components
- Standardize number endings to -it (from Russian)

5. General Principles:
- Maintain semantic transparency
- Prefer simpler phonological patterns
- Use regular endings for word classes
- Allow variation but within predictable patterns
