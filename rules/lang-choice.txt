Rules for selecting source language and words in Russenorsk:

1. Primary Domain Rule:
- Use Norwegian for maritime/nautical terminology
- Use Russian for trade goods and household items
- Use both languages for crucial trade/interaction terms

2. Functional Necessity Rule:
- Core concepts (numbers, basic verbs, common nouns) should have variants from both languages
- Choose simpler pronunciation when multiple options exist

3. Cultural Context Rule:
- Use source language of the culture that dominates the concept's domain
- For shared cultural concepts, prefer the simpler or shorter term

4. Phonetic Integration Rule:
- Prefer words that:
  * Are shorter and easier to pronounce
  * Match existing Russenorsk phonetic patterns
  * Can be easily modified with Russenorsk suffixes

5. Trade Interaction Rule:
- Use Russian for seller-side terminology
- Use Norwegian for buyer-side terminology
- Use both for neutral trade terms

6. Modern Concept Rule:
- Use Norwegian for modern/urban/official concepts
- Use Russian for traditional/household items

7. Merger Preference Rule:
- When words are similar in both languages, create a hybrid form
- Preserve recognizable roots from source languages

These rules should be applied in order of priority, with functional necessity and trade interaction rules taking precedence over others when conflicts arise.
