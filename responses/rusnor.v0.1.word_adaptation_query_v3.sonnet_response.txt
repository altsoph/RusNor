Let me analyze this data systematically.

<notes>
1. Russian endings transformation:
- Russian "-ый/-ий" → "-i" (krepkii from крепкий)
- Russian "-ть" → "-t" (desit from десять)
- Russian "-а/-я" → "-a" (ryba from рыба)
- Russian "-ка" → "-ka" (spitski from спички)

2. Vowel modifications:
- Russian "о" → "å" (råbotom from работать)
- Norwegian "o" → "å" (gå from gå)
- Russian "е" → "e/je" (djengi from деньги)
- Russian "у" → "u" (krupa from крупа)

3. Consonant changes:
- Russian "х" → "k" (kleba from хлеб)
- Russian "в" → "v" (tvoja from твоя)
- Russian "ш" → "s" (nas from наш)
- Russian "щ" → "s" (prosaj from прощай)
- Russian "ж" → "s" (desjevli from дешёвый)

4. Verb formation:
- Addition of "-om" suffix to verbs (råbotom, spisom, drikkom)
- Norwegian infinitives lose "-e" (sprek from språke)

5. Noun adaptations:
- Addition of "-a" to nouns (fiska from fisk)
- Addition of "-ka" to some nouns (fisska from fisk)

6. Consonant clusters:
- Simplification of complex clusters (spasiba from спасибо)
- Breaking clusters with vowel insertion (perevoj from первый)

Hypotheses about the rules:

1. Phonological:
- Complex Russian consonant clusters are simplified
- Voiced consonants tend to become voiceless
- Russian soft consonants become hard
- Certain Russian sounds are systematically replaced with simpler alternatives

2. Morphological:
- Verbs get standardized with -om ending
- Nouns often receive -a or -ka endings
- Adjectives lose complex Russian endings
- Numbers are standardized with -it ending (from Russian -ть)

3. Vowel system:
- Russian complex vowels are simplified
- Norwegian å is preserved
- Stress patterns are simplified
- Vowel harmony might be present

4. Word formation:
- Preference for bisyllabic words
- Compound words are possible but simplified
- Standardized endings for different parts of speech

Let me evaluate these hypotheses:
- The phonological rules are strongly supported by data
- Morphological patterns are very consistent
- Vowel system shows clear patterns
- Word formation rules are evident but with exceptions

Rules for adapting words into Russenorsk:

1. Phonological Rules:
- Replace Russian х → k
- Replace Russian в → v
- Replace Russian ш, щ, ж → s
- Simplify consonant clusters by:
  * Adding vowels between consonants
  * Dropping one of the consonants
  * Converting complex sounds to simple ones

2. Vowel Rules:
- Convert Russian о → å in stressed positions
- Preserve Norwegian å
- Simplify Russian ё → e/jo
- Keep basic vowels a, e, i, o, u
- Drop complex Russian vowel patterns

3. Morphological Rules:
For Verbs:
- Add -om to verb stems (primary rule)
- Alternative: use simplified stem + -a

For Nouns:
- Add -a to basic stems
- Add -ka to some stems (especially for tools/items)
- For Russian nouns: drop complex endings, add -a/-ka

For Adjectives:
- Convert Russian -ый/-ий → -i
- Convert Norwegian -ig → -i
- Use -li ending for some qualitative adjectives

4. Word Structure Rules:
- Prefer bisyllabic structure
- Keep stress on first syllable where possible
- Allow compound words but simplify their components
- Standardize number endings to -it (from Russian)

5. General Principles:
- Maintain semantic transparency
- Prefer simpler phonological patterns
- Use regular endings for word classes
- Allow variation but within predictable patterns
