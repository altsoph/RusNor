Since no sentence examples were provided, there are no specific instances to analyze step-by-step. However, we can still note general principles from known features of Russenorsk:

1. There is minimal inflection and nominal or verbal morphology; words often appear in a simplified form without full conjugations or declensions.  
2. Lexical items can come from Norwegian or Russian, sometimes with reduced or changed endings to fit a simplified phonology.  
3. Word order often resembles simplified Norwegian or Russian structures, but the pidgin typically follows a “Subject–Verb–Object” pattern for clarity.  
4. Grammatical markers (articles, case endings, tense markers, etc.) are often dropped or minimized, using short or invariant particles (if any) instead.  
5. Prepositions are used sparingly and can be adapted from both Russian and Norwegian or simplified.

• Hypothesis A: In Russenorsk, nouns do not decline for number or case. Instead, the same form is used for singular and plural, often relying on the context or additional words (e.g., “mange” for "many").  
• Hypothesis B: Verbs have only a single form (an infinitive-like shape) that does not conjugate for person or tense; time expressions (like “nå” for now) supply tense meaning.  
• Hypothesis C: Word order is paramount for indicating grammatical roles (subject, object, etc.), with some influence from Norwegian SVO order.  
• Hypothesis D: When necessary, short forms of Russian pronouns or Norwegian pronouns appear in place of full ones, with minimal agreement.  
• Hypothesis E: Adjectives may be placed before or after nouns with no agreement markers, relying primarily on context.  

Critique and consolidation:  
• Hypothesis A (lack of noun inflection) is strongly supported by documented Russenorsk language samples.  
• Hypothesis B (single verb form) is also strongly supported, with morphological simplicity widely noted.  
• Hypothesis C (importance of word order) is essential; Russenorsk is a pidgin that relies on straightforward, direct patterns.  
• Hypothesis D (simplified pronouns) aligns with the minimal morphological structure typical of pidgins.  
• Hypothesis E (lack of adjective agreement) is consistent with the construct of Russenorsk as a “restricted pidgin.”  

Therefore, the final set of morphological and grammatical rules can be drawn from these five solid points.

<final_answer>
1. Nouns do not decline for case, gender, or number. Context or quantifiers indicate plurality.  
2. Verbs typically have a single, unchanged form that does not inflect for person or tense; context and adverbs convey time and aspect.  
3. Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) word order is used to show grammatical relations clearly.  
4. Personal pronouns come in minimal, simplified forms (often borrowed directly from Norwegian or Russian).  
5. Adjectives do not change form or agree with nouns; they appear either before or after the noun but have no inflectional endings.  
6. Prepositions are scarce and usually borrowed, functioning in a simplified manner without complex case governance.
