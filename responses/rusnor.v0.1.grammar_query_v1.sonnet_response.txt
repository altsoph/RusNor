Let me analyze this step by step.

<notes>
1. Word order seems to follow Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern in most cases:
"Moja spåserom paa skib" (I walk on ship)
"Tvoja har konna?" (You have wife?)

2. Pronouns appear to be used consistently:
- moja/måja (I, me)
- tvoja/tvåja (you)
- on (he/it)

3. Preposition "paa/på" is extremely common and seems to be used for multiple purposes:
- location: "paa skib" (on ship)
- direction: "paa Norge" (to Norway)
- possession: "paa moja" (mine/for me)

4. Verbs often end in -om/-um:
- spåserom (walk)
- drikkom (drink)
- robotom (work)
- stannom (stay)

5. No apparent verb conjugation - same form used regardless of subject:
"moja drikkom" (I drink)
"tvoja drikkom" (you drink)

6. No articles (the/a/an) used

7. No plural marking on nouns

8. Time expressions often use "paa":
"paa den dag" (on that day)
"paa morradag" (tomorrow)

9. Questions formed by:
- word order inversion
- question words (kak, kor, nogoli)
- rising intonation (marked by ?)

10. Negation uses "ikke" or "njet":
"moja ikke ligom" (I not lie)
"njet fiska" (no fish)

11. Adjectives appear before nouns:
"gammel go vén" (old good friend)
"grot storm" (big storm)

12. No apparent case marking on nouns

13. Numbers precede nouns directly:
"tri daga" (three days)
"to voga" (two vog)

14. Compound expressions often formed by simple juxtaposition:
"tjåi drikkom" (tea drinking)
"fiska dragom" (fish pulling)

Hypotheses about grammatical rules:

1. Basic Sentence Structure:
- SVO word order seems dominant
- Preposition "paa" used extensively for relationships between words
- No subordinate clauses observed - simple sentences joined by "saa" (and/then)

2. Verb System:
- Verbs appear to have an infinitive/general form ending in -om/-um
- No tense marking observed
- No person/number agreement
- Some verbs borrowed directly without -om (har, skal, bli)

3. Noun System:
- No plural marking
- No case marking
- No articles
- Numbers and adjectives precede nouns
- Possession marked by "paa" + pronoun

4. Pronoun System:
- Limited set of pronouns (moja, tvoja, on)
- No case forms for pronouns
- Pronouns can function as possessives with "paa"

5. Question Formation:
- Using question words (kak, kor, nogoli)
- Word order inversion possible
- Rising intonation

6. Negation:
- "ikke" or "njet" before verb/noun
- No double negation observed

Some hypotheses seem weak:
- Complex verb forms (rejected - no evidence)
- Adjective agreement (rejected - no evidence)
- Complex subordination (rejected - no evidence)

Core Rules for Constructing Russenorsk Sentences:

1. Basic Sentence Structure:
- Use Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order
- Keep sentences simple - no complex subordination
- Join simple sentences with "saa" (and/then)
- Use "paa" as universal preposition for:
  * location ("paa skib")
  * direction ("paa Norge")
  * possession ("paa moja")
  * time ("paa den dag")

2. Verb Rules:
- Add -om/-um to verb stem for general form
- Use same verb form for all persons/numbers
- No tense marking needed
- Exception: Some common verbs (har, skal, bli) used without -om

3. Noun Rules:
- Use singular form only - no plural marking
- No articles needed
- No case marking
- Place numbers and adjectives before nouns
- Mark possession with "paa" + pronoun

4. Pronoun Usage:
- Use basic forms: moja/måja (I), tvoja/tvåja (you), on (he/it)
- Same form for subject and object
- For possession, use "paa" + pronoun

5. Questions:
- Use question words: kak (how), kor (where), nogoli (how much)
- Optionally invert word order
- Add question mark or use rising intonation

6. Negation:
- Place "ikke" or "njet" before what is being negated
- Use single negation only

7. Adjectives:
- Place before nouns
- No agreement/inflection needed
- Common intensifiers: grot (very/big), lita (little)

8. Numbers:
- Place directly before nouns
- No agreement needed

These rules suggest Russenorsk was highly simplified, avoiding complex grammar in favor of basic, functional communication patterns.
