Let me analyze this fascinating linguistic data.

<notes>
1. Trade terms often come from both languages equally (buy: kupi/kjøp)
2. Numbers seem to prefer Russian (odin, dva, tri...)
3. Maritime terms lean towards Norwegian (skip, båt)
4. Basic verbs often have variants from both languages
5. Food terms seem to prefer Russian (kleba, masla)
6. Time-related words often Norwegian (dag, morgen)
7. Fish names show mixed origins
8. Pronouns have variants from both languages
9. Some words merge both languages (kuasjorta)
10. Abstract concepts often Norwegian (sanfærdig)

Initial hypotheses about language choice:

1. Frequency of use in trade context
2. Phonetic simplicity
3. Length of word
4. Presence of difficult sounds
5. Cultural specificity
6. Technical precision
7. Emotional connotation
8. Social context of use
9. Geographic relevance
10. Historical precedence
11. Speaker's comfort
12. Listener's comprehension
13. Gesture compatibility
14. Semantic transparency
15. Morphological simplicity
16. Phonological patterns
17. Syllable structure
18. Stress patterns
19. Vowel harmony
20. Consonant clusters
21. Word-final sounds
22. Grammatical category
23. Semantic field
24. Usage frequency
25. Trade relevance
26. Maritime context
27. Cultural significance
28. Regional variation
29. Social status implications
30. Pragmatic function
31. Communicative context
32. Speaker relationships
33. Trade power dynamics
34. Environmental factors
35. Seasonal relevance

After analysis and criticism, many of these overlap or lack strong evidence. Some are more convincing than others.

Key Rules for Language Source Selection in Russenorsk:

1. Domain-Specific Rules:
- Maritime terminology preferentially from Norwegian (skip, båt, dekk)
- Food and household items typically from Russian (kleba, masla, moka)
- Trade terms equally from both languages to maintain neutrality
- Fish names from the language of primary catch zone

2. Structural Rules:
- Shorter words preferred over longer ones
- Words with simpler phonetic structure chosen
- Avoid difficult consonant clusters
- Preference for words ending in vowels

3. Functional Rules:
- Basic verbs often have variants from both languages for flexibility
- Numbers predominantly from Russian (possibly due to trade calculations)
- Time-related concepts prefer Norwegian
- Location terms balanced between languages

4. Cultural-Context Rules:
- Items specific to Russian culture use Russian words
- Norwegian-specific concepts retain Norwegian terms
- Shared concepts may take from either language
- New combined terms possible for shared cultural items

5. Practical Usage Rules:
- Frequently used terms often have variants from both languages
- Trade-specific terms maintain neutrality by using both sources
- Terms requiring precision use source language of expertise
- Emergency/safety terms use most widely understood source

6. Social-Dynamic Rules:
- Maintain balance between languages for respect
- Allow parallel terms for key concepts
- Avoid terms with negative connotations in either language
- Prefer terms that facilitate clear communication

7. Environmental-Context Rules:
- Seasonal terms follow local usage
- Weather terms from maritime tradition
- Geographic terms from local context
- Climate-specific terms from most relevant source

These rules should be applied hierarchically, with domain-specific rules taking precedence, followed by practical considerations, and then social/cultural factors.
