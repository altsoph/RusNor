I apologize, but I notice that both the <input_data> and <sentence_examples> tags are empty in your query. Without actual examples of Tabalotan sentences and vocabulary data, I cannot analyze the morphological and grammatical rules of the language.

To properly identify and describe the grammatical rules of Tabalotan, I would need:

1. A set of example sentences in Tabalotan with their translations
2. Vocabulary data showing words from both Swedish and Hindi sources
3. Multiple examples showing how words combine and change in different contexts

If you could provide some sample sentences in Tabalotan along with their translations, and some vocabulary data, I would be happy to:

1. Analyze the sentence structure
2. Identify patterns in word order
3. Determine morphological rules
4. Document grammatical conventions
5. Explain how words from Swedish and Hindi are adapted
6. Describe the complete set of rules for sentence construction

Please provide some example data and I will conduct a thorough analysis to determine the grammatical and morphological rules of Tabalotan.
