I apologize, but I notice that the <input_data> tags are empty - there are no actual examples of words or concepts provided for analysis. Without specific examples of words from the source languages (Swedish or Hindi) and their corresponding forms in Tabalotan, I cannot:

1. Analyze the actual morphological and phonetic changes
2. Identify patterns of modification
3. Determine the specific rules used for word adaptation

To provide a meaningful analysis of the morphological and phonetic rules of Tabalotan, I would need:

1. Original words from either Swedish or Hindi
2. Their corresponding Tabalotan forms
3. The concepts they represent
4. Multiple examples to identify consistent patterns

If you could provide some specific examples of words and their transformations, I would be happy to:
1. Analyze each case
2. Identify patterns
3. Formulate hypotheses about the rules
4. Test these hypotheses against the data
5. Provide a final set of confirmed rules for word adaptation in Tabalotan

Please provide some example data, and I will conduct the detailed analysis as requested in the instructions.
