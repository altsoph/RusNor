I apologize, but I notice that the <input_data> tags are empty in your request. Without specific examples of words that were modified when incorporated into Russenorsk, I cannot analyze the exact patterns of morphological and phonetic changes.

To properly analyze and determine the rules of word adaptation in Russenorsk, I would need examples such as:
- Original words from Russian or Norwegian
- Their Russenorsk variants
- The context or meaning of these words

However, I can share some general known facts about Russenorsk word adaptation:

<notes>
1. Russenorsk typically simplified complex consonant clusters
2. The language tended to use a limited set of vowels
3. Word endings often conformed to standard patterns
4. Many words ended in -om or -um
5. The language had a tendency to reduce phonological complexity
</notes>

Without specific examples to analyze, I can only hypothesize that the rules might have included:
1. Simplification of complex consonant clusters
2. Standardization of word endings
3. Vowel harmony adjustments
4. Reduction of phonetic complexity
5. Adaptation to shared Russian-Norwegian phonological features

<final_answer>
To provide accurate rules for word adaptation in Russenorsk, I would need specific examples from the actual pidgin. However, if you could provide some examples of words that were adapted into Russenorsk, I would be able to:
1. Analyze the specific phonetic changes
2. Identify patterns in morphological adaptation
3. Determine the exact rules for consonant and vowel modifications
4. Explain the standardization of word endings
5. Document any specific phonological simplification patterns

Please provide some examples of words and their adaptations into Russenorsk for a more detailed and accurate analysis.
