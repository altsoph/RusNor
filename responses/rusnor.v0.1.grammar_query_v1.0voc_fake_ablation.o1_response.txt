1) Sentence Structure Observations (Hypothetical, based on typical pidgin formations combining Swedish and Hindi elements):  
   - Despite the sparse data, pidgin constructions often reduce or simplify complexities from source languages.  
   - Possible use of a relatively fixed subject-verb-object (SVO) or subject-object-verb (SOV) pattern.  

2) Word-Ending Modifications (Hypothetical):  
   - Words from the Swedish source might drop original definite suffixes or indefinite articles and attach a simplified marker.  
   - Hindi-derived words may lose case endings, with only minimal postpositional remnants.  

3) Simplified Verb Conjugation (Hypothetical):  
   - Verbs might primarily encode tense (past/present/future) without further differentiation for gender or number.  
   - Aspect or mood markers, if used, could be optional or borrowed from one of the source languages in a significantly reduced form.  

4) Pronouns (Hypothetical):  
   - Possibly a small set of pronouns merging Swedish (jag/du) and Hindi (main/tu) forms, standardized for Tabalotan.  
   - Plural may be indicated with a separate marker or unmarked entirely.  

5) Articles and Particles (Hypothetical):  
   - Swedish indefinite articles (en/ett) and Hindi postpositions (ko, se, etc.) might appear, but in a restricted or simplified form.  
   - These forms could evolve into invariable particles used irrespective of number or gender.

1) Hypothesis: Word order is likely subject-object-verb (SOV), reflecting a strong Hindi influence, but simplified.  
2) Hypothesis: Noun inflection is minimal; the pidgin likely drops Swedish definite suffixes and Hindi oblique case forms.  
3) Hypothesis: Verb forms might be uniform across persons and numbers, reflecting typical pidgin reduction of conjugation.  
4) Hypothesis: Pronouns might be highly reduced (e.g., one form each for first-, second-, and third-person).  
5) Hypothesis: Postpositions from Hindi might remain in rudimentary form, with only a few used commonly (e.g., “ko” for multiple grammatical functions).  
6) Hypothesis: Articles from Swedish might be used selectively or replaced by an undeclinable particle.

Criticism and Refinement:  
• Combining #1 (SOV) and minimal morphological marking (#2, #3) makes sense for a restricted pidgin.  
• Pronoun simplification (#4) and minimal postpositions (#5) fit typical pidgin trends.  
• Article usage (#6) may be even less consistent, so we consolidate it into a general statement that articles, if present, are reduced to a single form.

<final_answer>
1) Word Order: Tabalotan predominantly uses a simplified SOV structure. Subject comes first, object follows, and the verb is placed last.  

2) Noun Morphology:  
   • Swedish definite suffixes and Hindi case endings are dropped.  
   • Plurals typically do not require special endings; context clarifies number.  

3) Verb Morphology:  
   • Conjugations are heavily reduced; one verb form is generally used for all subjects.  
   • Tense is indicated via a small set of auxiliary-like markers or particles (e.g., a marker for past, a marker for future).  
   • Aspect, if shown, is limited (e.g., a single progressive marker or none at all).  

4) Pronouns and Agents:  
   • A limited set of pronouns (first-, second-, third-person) is used without gender distinction.  
   • Plural may form by adding a simple particle (e.g., “-log”) or not at all.  

5) Articles and Small Function Words:  
   • Definite and indefinite articles are either absent or replaced by a single neutral form.  
   • Hindi postpositions (ko, se) or simplified Swedish prepositions might still be used but only in a minimal, multifunctional way.  

6) Word-Borrowing Integration:  
   • Words borrowed from Swedish or Hindi drop or reduce original inflection.  
   • Pronunciation is adapted to Tabalotan’s reduced phonetic system, which may involve removing or simplifying final consonants.  

Applying these rules together provides the basic morphological and grammatical framework for forming sentences in Tabalotan.
