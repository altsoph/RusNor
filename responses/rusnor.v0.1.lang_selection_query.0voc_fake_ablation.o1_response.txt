1) Hypothetical reasons for choosing Swedish words:
   - The concept relates to items, ideas, or practices originating from a Swedish environment.
   - Pronunciation or phonetic simplicity may align better with existing Tabalotan patterns.
   - The concept has a culturally embedded term in Swedish that Tabalotan speakers find convenient to adopt.

2) Hypothetical reasons for choosing Hindi words:
   - The concept is associated with geographical, cultural, or social elements related to Hindi-speaking contexts.
   - The Tabalotan phonology or morphological patterns favor Hindi-based forms for that concept.
   - The concept is already familiar through historical or direct trade/linguistic contact with Hindi speakers.

3) Overlapping or universal constraints could include:
   - Simpler or more recognizable word forms tend to be selected (ease of use in everyday Tabalotan).
   - Preference for terms that can be easily adapted into the Tabalotan sound system (fewer phonological changes needed).
   - Traditional usage or historical precedent in Tabalotan, where established borrowings may be retained over newly introduced terms.

Critique and Consolidation:
- “Cultural or contextual relevance” groups concepts that are either clearly Swedish or Hindi based on origin or typical usage.  
- “Phonological ease” and “morphological simplicity” can be combined into a single concept of “linguistic adaptability.”  
- “Historical precedent” remains an important factor, ensuring continuity in the pidgin’s usage patterns.

<final_answer>
1) Cultural or contextual relevance: Choose Swedish-origin words for concepts tightly associated with Swedish culture or environment; choose Hindi-origin words for concepts clearly tied to the Hindi-speaking cultural sphere.  
2) Linguistic adaptability: Prefer the source-language word that is simpler to pronounce, morphologically consistent, or more natural within Tabalotan’s sound system.  
3) Historical precedent: For concepts that have earlier or long-standing usage in Tabalotan, prioritize the traditionally borrowed term, preserving continuity.
