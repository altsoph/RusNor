1) Many sentences use a simple Subject–Verb–Object ordering:  
   • Example: “Moja spåserom paa skib” → “I walk on a ship.” (Moja = “I,” spåserom = from “spasere” + “om,” paa = “on,” skib = “ship.”)  
   • Example: “Junga grebi moja po lan’” → “(The) boy [row] me [to] land.” (Junga = “boy,” grebi = imperative of “to row” (from Russian “греби”), moja = “me,” po lan’ = “to land.”)

2) Pronoun usage is relatively free in word order, and pronouns remain in one form (no separate subject/object forms). “Moja” (I, me) may appear as subject or object without changing shape.  

3) Verbs often attach a final -om, -rom, or -m suffix, probably indicating “I do [verb]” or “we do [verb].” Sometimes this suffix merges with borrowed verbs with minimal internal changes. E.g.:  
   • “spaserom” (from Norwegian “spasere” = to walk) → “I walk/we walk,”  
   • “drikkom” or “drinkom” (from Norwegian “drikke” = to drink).  
   This ending is used variably, sometimes replaced by a short imperative form or an infinitive-like form.  

4) Tense markers are usually absent or replaced by adverbs/particles denoting time. The form does not normally change for past/present/future. Instead, words like “ska” (shall), “skal,” “blir,” “blir” (will be) show futurity.  

5) Negation is typically “njet,” “ikke,” “niet,” or “njeto,” placed before or after the verb (“Moja ikke ligom,” “Moja njet snai”).  

6) Prepositions (på, po, na, hos, etc.) come from Norwegian or Russian usage. Their usage is often simplified. E.g., “paa land” / “po lan,” “hos moja,” “na skib.”  

7) Adjectives often come before nouns (like “grot djur Mokka” = “very expensive flour,” from “grot” = “big, much,” “djur/dyr/dorgli” = “expensive”). Adjectives may not inflect for gender or number: “gammel go venn” = “old good friend.”  

8) The copula “to be” is often dropped; occasionally “ist,” “jes,” or “blir” appear for emphasis (e.g., “Ist moja fiska na moj paluba!” = “Is my fish on my deck!”).  

9) Possession can be shown explicitly with pronouns (moja, tvoja) or left to context. “Moja pen’ga” = “my money,” “Tvoja har konna?” = “Do you have (a) wife?”  

10) Plural is usually not marked, except by context or a separate word like “mange,” “plenty,” or “rebeta” (children). Words can stay in a singular-like form (e.g. “mange vikkel,” “plenty vikkel/weeks”).  

11) Questions often rely on intonation or question words from Russian/Norwegian (e.g., “Kak?” from Russian “как” = “how,” “Hvor/kor?” from Norwegian “hvor?” = “where,” or “Nogli?” as “How many?”). The question word + SVO order is common: “Kak pris på tvoja?” = “What (how) price on yours?”  

12) Imperatives either use the base verb form or can attach an -i/-y or -om: e.g., “grebi” from Russian “греби” = “row!,” “davai” = “give!” or “let’s go!”  

13) Coordinators like “og,” “saa” (“so,” “and”), “men” (“but”) appear freely, with usage borrowed from Norwegian or Russian.  

14) Lexical borrowing from either Russian or Norwegian can appear in the same sentence. The form is usually a simplified/approximated shape with minimal inflection.  

15) Function words or small linking words (e.g., “saa,” “no,” “naa,” “sjisjas”) are used ad hoc to mark time, linking, or emphasis. They do not necessarily follow consistent morphological rules.  

16) Often, verbs are used with no separate marker for person or number. “Moja spiserom” → “I eat,” “Ju spiserom” → “You eat,” “Han spiserom” → “He/it eats.”  

17) Modals like “vil,” “skal,” “ska” come from Norwegian but remain uninflected.

<thinking>
1) The data show that Russenorsk is a simplified pidgin with minimal inflection.  
2) Nouns do not normally show separate plural endings; number is indicated by additional words.  
3) Pronouns do not have separate subject or object forms; “moja” is both “I” and “me.”  
4) Verbs are generally uninflected for tense or person, sometimes using the suffix -om, -m, or -rom to mark an ongoing or personal sense of the verb.  
5) Word order is typically SVO, but can move around for emphasis.  
6) Negation words (njet, ikke) simply precede or follow the verb.  
7) Questions rely on question particles or intonation.  
8) No articles, or they are borrowed from other languages but used sporadically without morphological agreement.  
9) Adjectives do not inflect for gender or number.  
10) “To be” or copula is often omitted.  
11) Tense/time references are carried by adverbs or additional words (“nu,” “skoro,” “ska,” etc.).  
12) Prepositions come from both Russian and Norwegian (på, po, na, hos, etc.) with overlapping meanings.  
13) There is heavy lexical borrowing from Russian and Norwegian, typically adapted phonetically.  
14) Imperatives appear as a base form or with -i/-om.  
15) The pidgin has some high-frequency formulaic expressions (davai, drasvi, etc.) that do not change form.

<final_answer>
1) Word Order & Syntax  
   • Predominantly SVO (Subject–Verb–Object); prepositional or adverbial phrases usually follow.  
   • Minimal or no use of articles. Copula “to be” is commonly dropped.  
2) Pronouns  
   • Pronouns (e.g. “moja,” “tvoja,” “han”) do not change form (no separate subject/object forms).  
   • No standardized plural pronoun distinctions; context clarifies.  
3) Verbs  
   • Typically no person or tense inflection; a root verb form with optional suffixes (-om, -rom, -m) used (often meaning “I/we do X”).  
   • Tense expressed by adverbs or modal-like words (e.g., “ska,” “vil,” “blir,” time expressions).  
   • Imperative sometimes uses the base form, or an -i/-y ending (from Russian imperative) or “om.”  
4) Negation  
   • Negatives “njet,” “ikke,” “net,” placed before or just after the verb. No separate morphological marker.  
5) Nouns & Adjectives  
   • No morphological plural marking; “mange,” “plenty,” or measure words show quantity.  
   • Adjectives precede nouns without agreement in gender/number (common forms like “grot,” “staraja”).  
6) Question Formation  
   • Often signaled by intonation, or question words (kak, kor, skolko, etc.) from Russian/Norwegian.  
   • Word order usually remains SVO or a short reordering for emphasis.  
7) Prepositions & Particles  
   • Borrowed from Russian and Norwegian, used in simplified ways (på, po, hos, na).  
   • Some bridging words (“saa,” “og,” “men,” “no,” “nu”) for linking or emphasis.  
8) Lexical Borrowing & Phonetic Adaptation  
   • Vocabulary from both Russian and Norwegian, plus occasional English or other languages.  
   • Adapted phonetically, often dropping or modifying endings to fit simple forms (e.g. “driki,” “snakka,” “spiserom”).  
9) Overall Simplicity  
   • Russenorsk is a restricted pidgin; grammar is kept minimal.  
   • Meaning relies heavily on context, borrowed words, and shared reference.  

These core rules govern how words are put together in Russenorsk sentences.
