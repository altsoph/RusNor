I apologize, but I notice that both the <input_data> and <sentence_examples> tags are empty in your request. Without actual Russenorsk sentence examples and vocabulary data to analyze, I cannot make a detailed analysis of the morphological and grammatical rules of Russenorsk.

However, based on my knowledge of Russenorsk as a pidgin language, I can provide some general observations about its known grammatical features:

<thinking>
1. As a pidgin language, Russenorsk likely had:
- Simplified grammar compared to both Russian and Norwegian
- Limited vocabulary (estimated 150-400 words)
- Reduced morphological complexity
- Basic word order patterns
- Minimal inflection system

2. Historical context suggests:
- It was used primarily for trade
- Communication needed to be clear and functional
- Grammar would focus on essential meaning-making elements
</thinking>

<final_answer>
To provide accurate morphological and grammatical rules for Russenorsk sentence construction, I would need:
1. Actual sentence examples showing word order
2. Examples of how verbs are conjugated (if at all)
3. Examples of how nouns are declined (if at all)
4. Examples of how pronouns are used
5. Examples of how adjectives agree with nouns (if they do)

Without this data, I can only make general assumptions based on typical pidgin language characteristics, which wouldn't be sufficiently specific or accurate for your needs.

If you could provide some actual Russenorsk sentences and vocabulary data, I would be happy to analyze them and provide detailed morphological and grammatical rules.
