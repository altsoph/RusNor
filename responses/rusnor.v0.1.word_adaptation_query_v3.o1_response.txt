1) Many Russian infinitive/endings in -ать, -ить, etc. become -om or -a in Russenorsk (“rabotatʼ” → “råbotom”, “drikke” → “drikkom”, “skaffe” → “skaffom”). This suggests the addition of -om (or sometimes -a) as a verbal marker.

2) Final consonants from Russian/Norwegian words are often dropped or softened, or replaced with a vowel ending (“lånja” from “lang”, “rabota” → “råbotom”). Norwegian “-e” endings often become -a or -om. Russian endings like -ть and -т are dropped or turned into -om or -a.

3) Russian palatalized consonants (like ть, дь, сь) often lose the palatalization or turn into simpler forms: “смотрите” → “smotrom” or “посмотреть” → “påsmotrom”.

4) Voicing changes and consonant shifts occur:  
   – Russian “в” can become “v” or “w” or even vanish in some positions (“vrei” from “vred”).  
   – Russian “з” or “зд” clusters can turn into “s”/“st”/“str” (“здравствуй” → “strasvui”).  
   – Norwegian “k” before front vowels may become “tj”/“ch”/“kj” style (“koke” → “koga”, “kjøpe” → “kupom”).

5) Vowels are replaced, merged, or simplified, often taking a more open or simpler shape:  
   – Norwegian “ø”, “æ”, “å” may become “a”, “o”, or “u” (“dårlig” → “dåråleg(i)”, “norsk” → “norsk(e)” or “nor(sk)”).  
   – Russian “ы” can become “i” or “y” (“рыба” → “ryba”, “рк” → “rk” or “rik”).

6) Many borrowed words show reanalysis or insertion of extra syllables or substitution of unfamiliar clusters: “давай” → “davai”, “vare” + “товар” → “tovara”, “g” or “k” or “t” inserted, “продать” → “prodaj/prodåj”, “konnsul” → “konsul/kaansul”.

7) The consonant “h” from Norwegian can drop or become “g” or remain “h”, depending on position. Sometimes “g” from Norwegian merges with “k” or “h”, e.g. “hav” → “gav/gaf”, “hage” might become “aga” or “haka” (pattern seen with “gav” from “hav”).

8) Nasalization or cluster simplification: “-mn-” or “-gn-” can collapse to “n” or “m”. Norwegian “mange” plus Russian “много” → “mangeli”, “nogli”, etc. Variation in  nasal or guttural consonants is frequent.

9) Some borrowed words retain their initial letter but adopt Russenorsk vowels or endings, for example:  
   – “капитан/kaptein” → “kapitan”, “kapitån”, “kaptein”.  
   – “республика” might be “respublika”, etc.  
   – The morphological marker “-om” for verbs is especially common (drikkom, spaserom, sel(l)om).

10) Stress often shifts toward the first or second syllable in a simpler pattern (e.g., Russian “работáть” can become “rábotom” or “råbåtom,” with initial or penultimate stress). The orthography may reflect new stress patterns by dropping or altering unstressed vowels.

<thinking>
From the above notes, we see that Russenorsk tries to merge Norwegian and Russian (and sometimes English/Germanic) into a simplified, “pidginized” phonetic system. Common themes are:

• Loss or replacement of final Russian or Norwegian endings (-t, -ть, -e).  
• Introduction of the verbal ending -om (or sometimes -a).  
• Simplification of consonant clusters (“зд” → “str”, “kj-” → “tj-/k-”).  
• Vowel merging (Norwegian å, ø, æ → a or o; Russian ы → i/y).  
• Possible insertion or loss of consonants (“vater” from “water”, “gav” from “hav”).  
• General preference for simpler open syllables or fewer consonant clusters.  
• Stress shift or simplification, with the orthography re-spelled to match new stress or phonotactics.

Hypotheses for the system of rules:

1) Drop or change final consonants from Russian or Norwegian to an -a or an -om if it’s a verb.  
2) Collapse unusual vowel sounds to basic vowels (a, o, u, i, e).  
3) When confronted with palatalized consonants (like Russian ть, дь, ль), remove or reduce the palatalization (making it t, d, l), or turn it into an extra j-sound at times.  
4) Insert an extra vowel to break up clusters or adapt them: (spasere → spaserom).  
5) For verbs, particularly from Russian infinitives or Norwegian infinitives, add -om or -a as a morphological marker.  
6) Attempt to keep initial consonants but shift or replace them if they are unknown: “х” might become “h” or vanish; “зд” → “str”; Norwegian “kj” → “tj” or “k”.  
7) Merge or drop final syllables that are unstressed or complicated in the original language.  
8) Replace or drop “soft signs” or “ь”/“ъ”.  
9) Keep stress on the first or second syllable, re-spell accordingly.  

Criticism: Some minor rules might be sub-variants (like “здр” → “str” or “dr”). Consolidate them into “complex clusters become simpler.” The -om suffix is highly consistent for many borrowed verbs but not universal (some end in -a). The vowel changes can be grouped under “reduce to the common Russenorsk vowel set: a, e, i, o, u.”  

Final solid rules:  
• Reduction of final consonants or addition of a standard Russenorsk ending (-om or -a).  
• Simplify or adapt complicated vowel or consonant clusters.  
• Merge vowels and remove or reduce palatalization.  
• Possibly add an inserted vowel to break clusters.  
• Use typical Russenorsk stress (often penultimate) and re-spell.

<final_answer>
1) Verb endings: Russian -ать/-ить or Norwegian -e often become -om or -a in Russenorsk (e.g., “работать” → “råbotom,” “drikke” → “drikkom”).  
2) Unstressed/final consonants or syllables are dropped or replaced with a simpler vowel ending (e.g., “bestille” → “bestil,” “продай” → “prodaj”).  
3) Vowel simplification: Russian or Norwegian vowels (ы, ø, å, æ) are replaced by a small set (a, o, u, i, e). Palatal or nasal vowels are de-palatalized (no ь, no nasal).  
4) Consonant cluster reduction:  
   – Palatalized consonants lose the palatal quality (ть → t, дь → d, ш → s/sh depending on context).  
   – Initial clusters are simplified or re-mapped (“зд” → “str,” “kj” → “kj”/“tj”/“k”).  
5) Inserting extra vowels: If a cluster is too complex, an extra vowel (often “o” or “a”) is inserted (e.g., “drikkom,” “smotrom”).  
6) Stress is usually shifted to the first or second syllable, and spelling adjusts accordingly.  
7) Soft signs (ь, ъ) are dropped, and final -ть is removed or replaced (e.g., “смотреть” → “smotrom”).  
8) Morphological reanalysis often merges English/Norwegian/Russian shapes into a single system. “Om” or “a” marks verbs. Nouns frequently end in an open syllable (e.g., -a) or remain CVC.  

These steps collectively transform the original source word (Russian, Norwegian, etc.) into a simpler Russenorsk form, aligning to the pidgin’s limited phonological inventory and simplified morphology.
