I apologize, but I notice that the <input_data> tags are empty in your request. Without actual examples of Tabalotan words and their source languages (Swedish or Hindi), I cannot perform a meaningful analysis of the language selection patterns.

To properly analyze the rules and constraints that determine word selection in Tabalotan, I would need examples such as:
- Actual words used in Tabalotan
- Their meanings
- Their source language (Swedish or Hindi)
- Any context about their usage

If you could provide some sample data, I would be happy to:
1. Analyze each word/concept
2. Take notes on the patterns
3. Form hypotheses about language selection rules
4. Critically evaluate these hypotheses
5. Formulate final rules for source language selection

Please provide some example data, and I'll conduct this analysis to help determine the rules for word selection in Tabalotan pidgin.
