Observing the vocabulary records, Russenorsk words often have parallel variants derived from Russian, Norwegian, or other Germanic (and occasionally other) origins. Sometimes multiple synonyms coexist (e.g., “man/musik” for ‘man’), and sometimes one root from each parent language appears for the same concept (e.g., “den/dag” for ‘day’). The selection of one form over another seems influenced by phonetic preference, ease of pronunciation, frequency of usage in everyday trade contexts, or immediate linguistic environment.

<thinking>
1) Phonetic Simplicity Hypothesis: Words chosen because they are easier to pronounce for both Russian and Norwegian speakers (e.g., a simpler consonant cluster).

2) Frequent Exposure Hypothesis: The more often a term was heard from one side (Russian or Norwegian), the more that side’s variant stuck (e.g., “kom” for ‘to come’, from Norwegian usage in ports).

3) Trade Domain Clarity Hypothesis: Words specifically tied to trade or fishery might come from the language group that specialized in that product or concept (e.g., “trokk/trokkom” from foreign “troquer/trocar,” because French or Spanish might have been the known trading lingua).

4) Nautical Influence Hypothesis: Maritime terms might come predominantly from Norwegian due to Norwegians’ extensive usage of maritime vocabulary (e.g., “skib,” “båt,” “skuta”).

5) Russian Pivot Hypothesis: Some words reflect Russian morphological or phonetic shapes because of a strong influence from Russian merchants (e.g., “ryba” for fish).

6) Norwegian Pivot Hypothesis: Some words reflect Norwegian morphological or phonetic shapes because of a strong influence from Norwegian fishermen (e.g., “fisk”).

7) Hybrid Creation Hypothesis: In certain cases, both forms might merge phonetically (e.g., “tjåi” for ‘tea,’ combining Norwegian “te” with Russian “чай”).

8) Gestural Accompaniment Hypothesis: The chosen word might be the one that, when combined with gestures, was most readily understood by both parties (leading to a simpler or more universal form).

9) Socio-Linguistic Prestige Balance Hypothesis: Russenorsk avoided showing one language’s overt prestige, so speakers might alternate or mix synonyms to respect both cultures (e.g., “money” → “penga” from Norwegian, “djengi” from Russian).

10) Ease of Inflection Hypothesis: Speakers might choose a form that was easier to inflect or use in simplified grammar (e.g., “brukom” for ‘to use’?).

11) Familiar Sound Pattern Hypothesis: Certain words might have been chosen because their shape aligns with a more familiar phonological pattern in the pidgin (e.g., words ending in “-om” to denote verbs).

12) Memorability Hypothesis: Some terms might have stuck because they were easier to memorize collectively (e.g., short syllabic words).

13) Domain Priority Hypothesis: Russians might have had stronger lexical influence for items that Russians typically supplied or introduced, while Norwegians provided terms for items they introduced.

14) Single Consonant Preference Hypothesis: Consonant clusters that were too complicated could be avoided. For instance, if the Russian or Norwegian variant had fewer clusters, that form might be used.

15) Bilingual Intermediaries Hypothesis: If a bilingual “middleman” (perhaps a Sami or Finnish fisherman) found one word easier or had personal preference, that word might spread.

16) Market Interaction Hypothesis: Words commonly used in day-to-day trade transactions might come from whichever language was used more frequently in the moment of negotiation (e.g., “kosta” or “pris” for ‘price’ if Norwegian usage was more common in a certain port).

17) Morphological Adaptation Hypothesis: A word might be chosen if it was easier to adapt morphologically to the pidgin’s structure (e.g., “skrivom” from “skrive,” with the -om suffix to indicate a verb in Russenorsk).

18) Overheard Borrowing Hypothesis: Sailors might overhear a term in passing from, say, a third language (English, Dutch, French) and adopt it if it gained traction (like “me” → “mi” for ‘I, me’).

19) Simplicity of Syllable Count Hypothesis: Words with fewer syllables might triumph over more complex variants (e.g., “go” from Norwegian “god” instead of “dobra” for ‘good,’ in some contexts).

20) Social Network Centrality Hypothesis: Some central speakers (captains, major traders) might favor a certain variant, causing that variant to spread more widely through the Russenorsk community.

21) Rhyming or Alliteration Hypothesis: Possibly words that created a pleasing or rhythmic pattern in conversation (like “bom-bom,” “bon-bon” for ‘candy’) get used more frequently.

22) Time-Saving Hypothesis: In quick negotiations or conversation, shorter or more familiar words might be used simply because they saved time.

23) Literacy-Based Hypothesis: If a certain dictionary or phrasebook was printed or circulated, the forms in that text might become the standard (for example, if Norwegian authorities published a short Norwegian-based glossary).

24) Geographic Distribution Hypothesis: In areas closer to the Russian border, Russian-based terms dominated (like “saisja” for fish?), while in western coastal Norway, Norwegian-based forms dominated.

25) Pragmatic Variation Hypothesis: Speakers intentionally repeated synonyms from both sides to ensure comprehension (e.g., “et/odin” for ‘one’).

26) Seasonal Influence Hypothesis: Seasonal movements of Russian vs. Norwegian fishermen could cause alternating dips and rises in whichever language was more prevalent, thus solidifying certain words.

27) Peer Pressure Hypothesis: If a certain word was recognized as “the correct one,” new learners might adopt it to avoid social friction, creating local micro-standards.

28) Resemblance to Common Loanwords Hypothesis: Some words might be chosen if they resembled a known international borrowing or root (like “bank” for jam from Russian “банка,” but also recognized in other languages).

29) Negative Transfer Avoidance Hypothesis: Some words might be avoided if they had a misleading or taboo meaning in the other language, thus favoring a neutral alternative.

30) Influence of Cognates Hypothesis: russk. “витер” and norw. “vind” → might choose “vind” if the Russian form was less known, or “vina” for wine from both “vino” and “vin,” since they are close cognates.

Elaboration of Hypotheses:
• (1) Phonetic Simplicity: e.g., “dag” is simpler to pronounce than “den” for some speakers. 
• (2) Frequent Exposure: e.g., “kom” from Norwegian might have been shouted out a lot on a ship’s deck. 
• (3) Trade Domain Clarity: “laberdan” for dried cod came from Russian usage, possibly more recognized in fish markets. 
• (4) Nautical Influence: “båt” or “skuta” derived from Norwegian seafaring tradition. 
• (9) Prestige Balance: Russenorsk systematically included synonyms from both languages to show equality.
• (13) Domain Priority: “money” as “penga” or “djengi,” both used concurrently. 
• (19) Syllable Count: “tak” (1 syllable) might beat out “spasiba” (3 syllables) for quick talk, though both exist. 
• (23) Literacy-Based: Some might rely on the minimal Norwegian phrasebooks or references from local traders. 
• (25) Pragmatic Variation: E.g., “ryba/fisk” for fish, used side by side to ensure clarity.

Criticism, Merging, and Rejection:
• Many of these overlap in describing how frequency, ease, or social setting shape choice, so they can be merged (2, 3, 16, 20). 
• Some are quite niche (21, 29). 
• Some are robust, describing a wide scope: Phonetic/Pronunciation (1), Social/Prestige (9), Domain Priority (3, 13), Syllable/Ease (19), Bilingual Intermediaries (15), Pragmatic Variation (25). 
• Hypotheses about dictionary/literacy (23) and social networks (20) can be joined into a broader “Standardization or Social Influence” category. 
• Overall, the strongest pillars remain: 
   A) Pronunciation simplicity, 
   B) Frequency and domain usage, 
   C) Social/pragmatic or prestige balance, 
   D) Balanced bilingual input or parallel synonyms, 
   E) Familiar morphological shapes, 
   F) Ad hoc adoption based on immediate need.

<final_answer>
1) Pronunciation & Phonetic Simplicity: Speakers tended to choose or adapt words that were shortest, simplest, or easiest to pronounce.

2) Frequency & Common Domain Usage: The source language for a term often depended on who typically dominated that area of trade or everyday activity (e.g., Norwegian for shipping, Russian for certain market goods).

3) Social Balancing/Prestige Equivalence: Because neither language was considered superior, words from both Russian and Norwegian would remain in circulation for the same concept, creating synonyms.

4) Bilingual & Pragmatic Variation: Synonyms were used interchangeably to ensure comprehension. Bilingual speakers or local usage norms could tip the balance toward one form at different times.

5) Morphological or Lexical Familiarity: Words that fit a more recognizable morphological pattern (e.g., ending -om for verbs) or that resembled an already-familiar loanword could be selected.

6) Influence of Key Individuals or Documents: Certain captains, influential merchants, or even small phrasebooks could standardize specific variants, ensuring that those variants proliferated in daily pidgin use.
