• There is no data provided in the <input_data> tags. Therefore, there are no specific examples of words or changes to analyze case-by-case.  
• In general, based on Russenorsk historical study, words from other languages that entered Russenorsk were typically simplified or adjusted to reduce them to a fairly restricted phonetic structure.

1. Hypothesis: Vowels were replaced to fit fewer Russenorsk vowel sounds.  
2. Hypothesis: Consonant clusters were simplified by dropping or voicing certain consonants.  
3. Hypothesis: Syllable endings followed a common Russenorsk pattern (e.g., -a, -o, or -i) to make the word easier to pronounce.  
4. Hypothesis: Word stress might have shifted or been simplified.  
5. Hypothesis: Grammatical endings from the source language were discarded or replaced with a Russenorsk suffix.  

Criticism and Merging:  
• Points about vowel replacement and consonant simplification frequently overlap, since both involve simplifying the sound structure.  
• Shifting stress patterns is less thoroughly attested, but plausible.  
• Replacing foreign endings with standard Russenorsk terminal vowels or syllables is a well-documented practice.  
• Discarding grammatical endings is also in line with pidginization strategies.  

The most solid and consistently recorded modifications are the vowel replacements, consonant simplifications, and the replacement of original endings with simpler, more standard Russenorsk endings. These should form the core set of recognized morphological and phonetic rules.

<final_answer>
1. Reduction of Vowel Variety: Vowels are replaced or merged to fit a narrower Russenorsk vowel inventory (e.g., foreign vowel distinctions collapse into fewer Russenorsk vowels).  
2. Consonant Simplification or Voicing/Devoicing: Consonant clusters are broken up or a consonant is voiced/devoiced based on ease of pronunciation in Russenorsk.  
3. Standardized Endings: Original endings from the source language are dropped or replaced with a small set of Russenorsk endings (often an -a, -o, or -i sound).  
4. Loss of Unnecessary Grammar Markers: Grammatical elements from the source language (plural or case endings) are usually removed to simplify usage.  
5. Streamlined Syllable Structure: A word may be reshaped to fit the common Russenorsk syllable pattern, often by removing or mutating awkward consonant clusters.
