I apologize, but I notice that the <input_data> tags are empty in your request. Without specific examples of Russenorsk words and their origins to analyze, I can provide a general framework for analyzing language source selection in pidgin languages like Russenorsk, based on historical and linguistic research:

<thinking>
General principles that typically govern word source selection in pidgin languages:

1. Frequency of use:
- Words for commonly used concepts tend to come from both source languages
- More specialized terms often come from the dominant trading partner

2. Semantic domains:
- Trade-related terms often come from the economically dominant group
- Maritime terms often come from the group with stronger maritime tradition
- Cultural items tend to come from their culture of origin

3. Phonological simplicity:
- Simpler pronunciation variants are often preferred
- Words that fit the pidgin's phonological patterns are favored

4. Pragmatic factors:
- Terms related to immediate communication needs are prioritized
- Words for negotiation and trade are particularly important

5. Social dynamics:
- Power relationships between groups can influence word selection
- Mutual intelligibility considerations

Rules for selecting source language for new Russenorsk words:

1. Primary Domain Rule:
- Use Russian for trade goods, measurements, and numbers
- Use Norwegian for maritime and fishing terminology
- Use source language of cultural concept for cultural terms

2. Practical Usage Rule:
- Choose the simpler pronunciation between Russian and Norwegian options
- Prefer words that follow Russenorsk phonological patterns
- Select terms that are easily recognizable to both groups

3. Communication Priority Rule:
- For core communication concepts, use words from both languages
- For specialized concepts, use terms from the domain expert group
- For new concepts, use terms from the introducing culture

4. Functional Load Rule:
- Choose words that maintain clear distinctions between important concepts
- Avoid ambiguous terms that might cause trading mistakes
- Select terms that can be easily modified within Russenorsk grammar

Note: To provide more specific and accurate rules, I would need actual examples of Russenorsk vocabulary and their source languages to analyze patterns.
