Let me analyze this step by step.

<notes>
1. Basic concepts (numbers, pronouns) often have variants from both Russian and Norwegian: "one" (odin/en), "two" (dva/to)
2. Maritime terms tend to lean towards Norwegian: "ship" (skip/skib), "deck" (dekk)
3. Trade-related terms often come from Russian: "money" (diengi/dengi), "sell" (prodai)
4. Food items often take from Russian: "bread" (kleba), "butter" (masla)
5. Modern/urban concepts tend to use Norwegian: "policeman" (polismann)
6. Some words merge both languages: "captain" (kapitan - similar in both)
7. Common verbs often have variants from both: "to buy" (kupi/kjøp)
8. Time-related words tend to use Norwegian: "week" (vegel), "day" (dag)
9. Nature terms show mixed origin: "wind" (vind - Norwegian), "sea" (gav from hav - Norwegian)
10. Family terms show mixed usage: "father" (far - Norwegian), "son" (sønn/siin - both)

Hypotheses for language choice:
1. Frequency of interaction - terms used more often in trading context tend to come from Russian
2. Domain specificity - maritime terms favor Norwegian as they were the seafaring experts
3. Cultural dominance - household items often use Russian terms
4. Phonetic simplicity - words that are easier to pronounce tend to be preferred
5. Mutual intelligibility - words that sound similar in both languages are preferred
6. Functional necessity - concepts crucial for trade get words from both languages
7. Historical precedence - traditional items keep original language terms
8. Social context - formal/official terms tend toward Norwegian
9. Environmental context - nature terms prefer the language of the dominant culture in that domain
10. Word length - shorter variants tend to be preferred
11. Vowel harmony - words that fit existing phonetic patterns are preferred
12. Trade power dynamics - the seller's language might be preferred for trade terms

Rules for selecting source language and words in Russenorsk:

1. Primary Domain Rule:
- Use Norwegian for maritime/nautical terminology
- Use Russian for trade goods and household items
- Use both languages for crucial trade/interaction terms

2. Functional Necessity Rule:
- Core concepts (numbers, basic verbs, common nouns) should have variants from both languages
- Choose simpler pronunciation when multiple options exist

3. Cultural Context Rule:
- Use source language of the culture that dominates the concept's domain
- For shared cultural concepts, prefer the simpler or shorter term

4. Phonetic Integration Rule:
- Prefer words that:
  * Are shorter and easier to pronounce
  * Match existing Russenorsk phonetic patterns
  * Can be easily modified with Russenorsk suffixes

5. Trade Interaction Rule:
- Use Russian for seller-side terminology
- Use Norwegian for buyer-side terminology
- Use both for neutral trade terms

6. Modern Concept Rule:
- Use Norwegian for modern/urban/official concepts
- Use Russian for traditional/household items

7. Merger Preference Rule:
- When words are similar in both languages, create a hybrid form
- Preserve recognizable roots from source languages

These rules should be applied in order of priority, with functional necessity and trade interaction rules taking precedence over others when conflicts arise.
