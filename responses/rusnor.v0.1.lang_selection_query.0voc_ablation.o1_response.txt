Without example words, we can still propose hypotheses for how one might choose which language to draw from when introducing a new word into Russenorsk. Possible reasons include:
• The concept’s cultural or geographic origin (e.g., a concept strongly associated with Norwegian seafaring or Russian trade traditions might come from Norwegian or Russian respectively).
• The simplicity or clarity of pronunciation (one language’s term might be easier to pronounce or chunk into a Russenorsk phonological pattern).
• The relative familiarity of the speakers with either language’s term.
• Historical precedent or widely observed usage patterns within Russenorsk circles.
• Existing set phrases or idioms (the presence of partial forms might nudge the language choice).

Critique and reduce to solid points:
1. Cultural or geographic association is almost always relevant (if it’s a “Norwegian” fishing tool or “Russian” caravan technology, the word usually comes from that language).  
2. Pronunciation and phonetic fit are essential to preserve ease of use.  
3. Familiarity among users helps with quick adoption.  
4. If a concept is deeply rooted in existing idioms (no matter the origin), that idiom is a strong influence.  

Merged final hypothesis set:  
• Origin of the concept (including cultural/historical ties).  
• Pronunciation and ease of use for speakers.  
• Community familiarity and usage patterns.  
• Continuity with known Russenorsk idioms or partial borrowed forms.

Rules to decide from which language a new concept’s word is most likely drawn in Russenorsk:  
1. Identify the cultural or historical context behind the concept, choosing the language (Norwegian or Russian) most closely or traditionally linked to it.  
2. Consider pronunciation and simplicity: pick the term that is easiest for speakers of both backgrounds to articulate and integrate into Russenorsk phonology.  
3. Check existing usage and familiarity: if speakers already recognize a version of the word in one language, prefer that.  
4. Weigh existing partial borrowings or related idioms in Russenorsk: if the concept connects to an existing borrowed form or set phrase, select the language that aligns with that usage.
