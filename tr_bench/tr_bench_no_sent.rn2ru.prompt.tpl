<source_language_selection_rules>
Rules for selecting source language and words in Russenorsk:

1. Primary Domain Rule:
- Use Norwegian for maritime/nautical terminology
- Use Russian for trade goods and household items
- Use both languages for crucial trade/interaction terms

2. Functional Necessity Rule:
- Core concepts (numbers, basic verbs, common nouns) should have variants from both languages
- Choose simpler pronunciation when multiple options exist

3. Cultural Context Rule:
- Use source language of the culture that dominates the concept's domain
- For shared cultural concepts, prefer the simpler or shorter term

4. Phonetic Integration Rule:
- Prefer words that:
  * Are shorter and easier to pronounce
  * Match existing Russenorsk phonetic patterns
  * Can be easily modified with Russenorsk suffixes

5. Trade Interaction Rule:
- Use Russian for seller-side terminology
- Use Norwegian for buyer-side terminology
- Use both for neutral trade terms

6. Modern Concept Rule:
- Use Norwegian for modern/urban/official concepts
- Use Russian for traditional/household items

7. Merger Preference Rule:
- When words are similar in both languages, create a hybrid form
- Preserve recognizable roots from source languages

These rules should be applied in order of priority, with functional necessity and trade interaction rules taking precedence over others when conflicts arise.

<task>
Your task is to translate the numerated list of sentences given inside the <input_text> tags from Russenorsk into Russian strictly following the instruction from <instructions> tags.
</task>

<instructions>
- First, enumerate all the words and concepts in the input text, so we will have a list of necessary concepts (you can write them down inside the <thinking> tags).
- Next, decide, which of these concepts are presented in the <vocabulary> or <examples> -- explicitly or maybe could be described as a construction of several existing. Write them down.
- Now, for each of the rest concepts (which are not covered by the <vocabulary> or <examples>), decide what word from what language should we borrow (based on the <choice_language_instruction>). Write them down.
- Then, for each of the borrowed word, simplify it to the form natural for Russenorsk, based on the <word_transformation_instruction>. Write them down.
- Compile the sentences based on <grammar_rules>.
- Finally, inside the <final_answer> tag, provide the numerated list of translated sentences and nothing else.
</instructions>
